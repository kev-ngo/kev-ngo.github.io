### Blockchain and the problems it addresses 
Today, most information is controlled and managed by institutions that we trust
to act honestly.  These institutions store our data in centralized databases
like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. 

Blockchain technology allows for the shift from centralized databases to
decentralized ones.  Here's a more formal definition:

> Blockchain is a **decentralized** and **public** digital **ledger**.  Ledger
> entries are **immutable** and **auditable**.

**Ledgers** are the foundation of accounting. A ledger is a book of transactions
posted in the form of debits and credits.  There are many benefits when
record-keeping is done by a central authority.  Here are two of them:

- **Data integrity:** A central authority can restrict access to the ledger to
    only authorized users.
- **Speed:** A centralized database allows for faster query results from the
    client
